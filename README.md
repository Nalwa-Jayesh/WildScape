Hi, this is team Code Ignite, and we've recreated the Nandankanan zoo from Odisha

So the Nandankanan Zoo in Odisha is home to a diverse range of wildlife, but many people cannot visit in person due to geographical constraints, time limitations, or physical disabilities. 
Moreover, natural disasters, lockdowns and other restrictions hinders access to natural wonder.
Wildscape, our VR zoo addresses these issues head-on.

So with the launch of Apple Vision pro, and oculus quest, VR is emerging to be the next big leap in tech

Wildscape offers a lifelike, interactive, and educational experience. Here's how it works:

## Immersive Environment: 
Users step into a virtual Nandankanan Zoo, complete with realistic animal habitats, lush landscapes, and informative exhibits.

## Realistic Animals: 
we painstakingly recreated the animals in high fidelity using Unreal Engine and the animals are powered by ai, which offer a wide range of animations and interactions. Additionally, visitors can get up close to them without any danger.

## Interactive Learning: 
Wildscape is not just about sightseeing. It's an educational tool, offering users the opportunity to learn about the animals, their habitats, and conservation efforts through interactive exhibits

## Accessibility: 
By using VR technology, we've made the Nandankanan Zoo accessible to everyone, regardless of physical location or mobility issues.


## Business Model n future scope:
Wildscape offers a sustainable revenue model:

the zoo can charge a small fee for an immersive tour. with the huge number virtual guests, it can boost the revenue of the zoo and be reinvested in conservation efforts.


## The Impact:
it also has a significant social impact:

Education: We're fostering a love for wildlife and environmental conservation through immersive education.

Inclusivity: Wildscape ensures that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, can connect with nature and wildlife.


## Future:
now onto the future scope.
we had also planned a few more features, but due to time constraints we werent able to implement them.


## Expansion:

Expanded Wildlife: our zoo has about 5-6 species, but the actual zoo has over 30 . we r plannign to expand n add the remaining species , which will allow us to explore the full diversity of the Nandankanan Zoo from the comfort of our home.
 
we'll also add an
AI Narrator: As you approach each exhibit, the narrator will engage you with fascinating facts about the animals, their habits, and conservation efforts.

also, this can be also extended to other zoos and natural wonders, so the possibilites are endless


Wildsacpe solves a real problem, has a viable business model, and makes a positive impact, and it is redefining the future of eco-adventures.
